    "# Refining Raw Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to apply `VocalForge.audio` pipelines on audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pipeline will (or at least attempt to) remove poor/inappropiate audio from each file in order to better prime it for dataset creation, or whatever other purpose you have in mind. These can be done in different order, or some not at all. It's up to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "The models generally consist of a neural network designed to identify a specific piece of audio, then mark timestamps for its removal. Let's go over the ones currently supported in order to better illistrates VocalForge's usefulness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Voice Detection` will remove segments of audio in which no human sounds are found. Say there is a long segment of city noise, or a musical intro to a podcast, all of this is removed. This is helpful not only in that it removes any of that non human audio, but it also reduces the time in which the subsequent audio takes to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Overlap` covers speech that has two or more people talking at the same time. Not only does it forceably remove egotistical people from trying to take over a conversation, but it *also* removes poor audio from podcasts or other casual conversational settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Isolate` one of the less straightforward pipelines, it goes through and seperates each speaker in each audio file. From there, you as a user can specify a specific speaker you want to target and it will find that same user across each audio file, even in different recording enviroments, such as a recording studio and a park. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Export` is really just to put everything in a nice little bow. Given a directory, it will format on sample rate, as well as optionally normalize and noise reduce the audio. \n",
    "\n",
    "More pipelines are coming soon™"

This can be either done through an input() prompt, or specified in the class through the `speaker_id` variable. If you have already calculate the voice data on your own, you can input the info under `speaker_fingerprint`.\n",

The `verification_threshold` is the score it must reach in order to be considered the same person and can be modified as need be. Say that all the speakers in a file does not match the voice enough to reach verification_threshold, the process will repeat by negating 0.05 to verification_threshold until it reaches the `lowest_threshold`, or finds a match.
